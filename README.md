# Profile Registration and Profile Page

This project is a simple interactive site built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. It consists of two main pages: a Profile Registration page and a Profile page.

## Overview

The Profile Registration page allows users to register by filling out a form with the following fields:

- First Name: Accepts only letters.
- Last Name: Accepts only letters.
- Email: Requires a valid email format.
- Password: Must be at least 8 characters long, accepting alpha-numeric and special characters
- Confirm Password: Must match the password field.
- Proper front-end validations are implemented using JavaScript to ensure all fields meet the specified criteria. Upon successful validation, users are redirected to the Profile page, which displays their basic profile details such as First Name, Last Name, and Email.
